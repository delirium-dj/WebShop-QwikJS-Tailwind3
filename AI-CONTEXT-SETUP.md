## 🎯 How to Use

### For Web UI AI Chat

1. Open `AI.md` in your editor
2. Select all content (Ctrl+A)
3. Copy to clipboard
4. Paste into your web UI AI chat interface
5. Ask the AI to analyze or implement features

**Example prompt:**

> "Based on this project context, implement a new [feature]. Follow the established patterns and maintain consistency with existing code."

### For Project Maintenance

1. After completing major features, run the skill workflow
2. Review and update `AI.md` sections as documented
3. Commit updated `AI.md` to version control
4. This keeps the web UI AI always in sync with project state

## 💡 Pro Tips

**Tip 1: Keep It Current**
Run the skill workflow quarterly or after major changes to maintain accuracy.

**Tip 2: Use as Documentation**
Share AI.md with team members or new developers as project documentation.

**Tip 3: Web UI Comparison**
Drop AI.md into a web UI AI, ask it to implement something, then compare with your IDE AI implementation.

**Tip 4: Quick Answers**
Grep for specific patterns in AI.md when you need to remember how something works.

**Tip 5: Archive Versions**
If you want to track changes, save old versions in `tasks/` before updating.
