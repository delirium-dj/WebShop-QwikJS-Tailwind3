# Styling with Tailwind CSS 3

<div class="relative mx-auto my-8">
  <picture>
    {Object.entries(blogImage.sources).map(([key, value]) => (
      <source key={key} srcset={value} type={"image/" + key} />
    ))}
    <img
      src={blogImage.img.src}
      class="h-64 object-cover rounded-2xl shadow-xl"
      alt="Styling with Tailwind"
      width={blogImage.img.w}
      height={blogImage.img.h}
      fetchpriority="high"
    />
  </picture>
</div>

Tailwind CSS provides a utility-first approach to styling that perfectly complements Qwik's component model. It allows us to build a premium, consistent design system without writing massive amounts of custom CSS.

## Our Design System

- **Consistency**: Using predefined tokens for colors, spacing, and typography.
- **Speed**: Rapidly iterate on UI changes.
- **Optimization**: Tailwind's JIT engine ensures that only the CSS we use is included in the final bundle.

Design is not just how it looks, it's how it works. And with Tailwind, it works beautifully.
