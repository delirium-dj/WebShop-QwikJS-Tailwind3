# The Power of Resumability

<div class="relative mx-auto my-8">
  <picture>
    {Object.entries(blogImage.sources).map(([key, value]) => (
      <source key={key} srcset={value} type={"image/" + key} />
    ))}
    <img
      src={blogImage.img.src}
      class="w-full rounded-2xl shadow-xl"
      alt="The Power of Resumability"

</div>

Resumability is the core innovation of Qwik. Unlike traditional frameworks that require "hydration" (re-executing the entire app on the client to make it interactive), Qwik simply resumes where the server left off.

## How it Works

1. **Server Side**: The application is rendered to HTML on the server.
2. **Serialization**: The state of the application is serialized into the HTML.
3. **Resumption**: When the user interacts, Qwik downloads only the necessary code and resumes execution using the serialized state.

This means zero initial JavaScript execution, leading to a perfect lighthouse score and a superior user experience.
