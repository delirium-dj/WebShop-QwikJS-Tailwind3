Security is a top priority for ReconShop. We use Supabase to handle authentication, ensuring that user data is protected with industry-standard protocols.

## Key Features

- **Google OAuth**: Seamless login with a trusted provider.
- **Protected Routes**: Ensuring only authorized users can access sensitive account information.
- **Resilient Sessions**: Managing user state effectively across the application.

Trust is built with security, and Supabase helps us maintain that trust with every interaction.
