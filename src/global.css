 * UI Layout Stability Fix
 * Property: scrollbar-gutter: stable
 * Why: This prevents the "jumping" effect where the header or content shifts 
 * horizontally by a few pixels when a vertical scrollbar appears or disappears.
 * It reserves space for the scrollbar even if the page content isn't long enough to scroll.
